The Music Player Web Application is a responsive, user-friendly platform designed to provide
seamless audio playback and efficient music management via web browsers. Developed using
modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and optionally ReactJS for
enhanced interactivity, the application allows users to upload, search, organize, and stream their
personal music collection. Core features include playlist creation, real-time playback controls,
song filtering, and volume adjustment, all presented through an intuitive graphical user interface.
The application also implements essential security practices such as secure login and file
validation to ensure safe user interaction. It is compatible across devices including desktops,
tablets, and smartphones, offering flexibility and accessibility. Through various testing
phases—unit, integration, and beta—the system demonstrated strong performance, functionality,
and reliability.
This project aims to replicate the basic experience of traditional music players while leveraging
the advantages of a web-based system, such as accessibility without software installation and
easier updates. Future enhancements may include offline support, social sharing, AI-based
recommendations, and a mobile app version. Overall, this web application serves as a lightweight
yet effective solution for users seeking personalized and accessible online music streaming.
